# Wordpress Theme IAMDAVIDSTUTZ

This is the theme used for my personal webpage [davidstutz.de](http://davidstutz.de/). It is licensed under the [GPLv3](http://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl). If you use parts of this theme, please change the content both the header and the footer!

**Note:** The "Reading" section of the template (based on the category with slug `reading`) requires the Advanced Custom Fields Plugin to be installed and supports two fields for posts with category `reading`: `reference` and `pdf`. The content of `reference` describes the main content of the post, and `pdf` refers to a link (where to find the paper or book referenced by `reference`).
